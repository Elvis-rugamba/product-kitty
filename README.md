# product-hunt-react-native
A Product Hunt iOS app built in React Native

## Installation
You'll want to make sure `react-native-cli` and `watchman` are installed, as well as Xcode on your machine to run iOS Simulator.

In `/App/Utils` you'll want to create a file named `keys.js` that will contain an object named `keys`. It should have two string properties: `key` (your Product Hunt Client ID) and `secret` (your Product Hunt Client Secret).

Don't forget to export it.
